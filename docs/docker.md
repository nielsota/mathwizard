# Docker Guide

## Running the App

```bash
# Start the app with hot-reload
docker compose up

# Rebuild after changing dependencies
docker compose build
docker compose up

docker compose down
```

That's it! The app runs at **http://localhost:8000**

## Hot-Reload

When you edit files in `src/`, the container auto-reloads within 1-2 seconds.

If hot-reload isn't working:
```bash
docker compose down
docker compose build
docker compose up
```
